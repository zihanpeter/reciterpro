# Introduction of Reciter Pro
Written by Peter Lu in 2024

## 1. Welcome
If you are willing to run and use C++ apps on your computer, Reciter Pro will be a good choice. It was developed by C++, which made it fast, stable, and easy to use. You can just download volcabulary resources on the Reciter website, import them to the Reciter Pro, and then you can start!

In this Intro, we will spend several minutes to explain how you can use the Reciter Pro more conveniently.

What's more, welcome to Reciter Pro!

## 2. The format of volcabulary resources
There is just one difference between Reciter web and Reciter Pro, and our guidance will base on the format of Reciter web.
